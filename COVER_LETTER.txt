Dear Bantam Tools Team,

I'm a Bantam user who loves your machine and software. I've been using it to
mill PCBs designed in Fusion 360, and recently ran into an issue where some
of my components weren't showing up when I imported my BRD files.

After some investigation, I discovered the root cause: when Fusion 360 exports
a BRD file with components from multiple library sources, it creates duplicate
library entries with the same name but different identifiers. Bantam's parser
doesn't handle this correctly, causing some components to silently disappear.

I reported this issue about a year ago and was told it was a known issue. Since
it still hasn't been fixed, I decided to dig deeper and put together this
package to help your engineering team resolve it.

RESOURCES
---------
I've created two public resources to help users and your engineering team:

  Web Repair Tool:  https://bantamfix.com
  GitHub Repo:      https://github.com/TSJim/BantamFix.com

The web tool lets users fix their BRD files immediately (all processing
happens in the browser - no uploads). The GitHub repo contains complete
documentation, test files, and source code your engineers can reference.

WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GITHUB REPO
----------------------------------
- Clear explanation of the bug and root cause analysis
- Test files that reproduce the issue (BROKEN.brd and FIXED.brd)
- Working repair tool with extensively documented source code
- Implementation guidance with pseudocode for your engineers
- Before/after screenshots showing the problem

The fix itself is straightforward - essentially just merging same-named
libraries when loading the file. The brd-fixer.js source code shows exactly
how to do this and can serve as a reference implementation.

WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------
This bug affects anyone using Fusion 360 to design PCBs for Bantam. It's
easy to trigger accidentally, and the silent failure mode means users might
not notice missing components until after milling. I suspect many users have
been bitten by this without understanding why.

MY ASK
------
Please forward this to your engineering team. I've tried to make their job
as easy as possible by providing everything they need: root cause analysis,
test cases, and working code they can reference.

I'm happy to answer any questions or provide additional information.

Thank you for your time, and thank you for making such a great machine!
