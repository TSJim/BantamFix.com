Dear Bantam Tools Team,

I'm a long-time Bantam user - one of the very first OtherMill customers, in
fact. I currently run three OtherMill units: two standard machines and one Pro.
I love your machines and have been using them to mill PCBs designed in Fusion
360 for years.

I'm writing about a bug that causes components to silently disappear when
importing BRD files from Fusion 360. I first reported this issue to your
technical support on May 18, 2022 (from jim@jimsgear.com) and was told it was
a known issue. Since it still hasn't been fixed nearly three years later, I
decided to dig deeper and put together this package to help your engineering
team resolve it.

THE BUG
-------
When Fusion 360 exports a BRD file with components from multiple library
sources, it creates duplicate library entries with the same name but different
URN identifiers. Bantam's parser doesn't handle this correctly - it keeps only
one library and discards the others, causing components to silently disappear.

RESOURCES
---------
I've created two public resources to help users and your engineering team:

  Web Repair Tool:  https://bantamfix.com
  GitHub Repo:      https://github.com/TSJim/BantamFix.com

The web tool lets users fix their BRD files immediately (all processing
happens in the browser - no uploads). The GitHub repo contains complete
documentation, test files, and source code your engineers can reference.

WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GITHUB REPO
----------------------------------
- Clear explanation of the bug and root cause analysis
- Test files that reproduce the issue (BROKEN.brd and FIXED.brd)
- Working repair tool with extensively documented source code
- Implementation guidance with pseudocode for your engineers
- Before/after screenshots showing the problem

The fix itself is straightforward - essentially just merging same-named
libraries when loading the file. The brd-fixer.js source code shows exactly
how to do this and can serve as a reference implementation.

WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------
This bug affects anyone using Fusion 360 to design PCBs for Bantam. It's
easy to trigger accidentally, and the silent failure mode means users might
not notice missing components until after milling. I suspect many users have
been bitten by this without understanding why.

MY ASK
------
Please forward this to your engineering team. I've tried to make their job
as easy as possible by providing everything they need: root cause analysis,
test cases, and working code they can reference.

I'm happy to answer any questions or provide additional information.

Thank you for your time, and thank you for making such a great machine!
