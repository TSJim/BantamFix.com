================================================================================


THE PROBLEM
-----------
When I import a BRD file from Fusion 360 into Bantam Tools, some of my
components don't appear. There's no error message - they just silently
disappear.

In my case: 2-pin headers show up fine, but 4-pin and 5-pin headers vanish.


WHY IT HAPPENS
--------------
Fusion 360 saves components from different library sources (local, cloud,
team libraries) as separate entries in the BRD file, even when they have
the same library name. It uses a "URN" identifier to tell them apart.

Bantam Tools ignores these URN identifiers. When it sees multiple libraries
with the same name, it only keeps ONE of them. Components from the
discarded libraries fail to render.


PROOF
-----
I'm including two test files:

  BROKEN.brd  - My original file. Open it in Bantam - some headers are missing.
  FIXED.brd   - Same design, libraries consolidated. All headers appear.

The only difference is how the libraries are organized. Same components,
same design, same everything else.


THE FIX
-------
When Bantam loads a BRD file and finds multiple libraries with the same
name, it should merge them together (combine all their packages) instead
of throwing some away.

I've included a working repair tool that does exactly this. The source
code is fully documented and can serve as a reference for your engineers.

WORKAROUND FOR USERS
--------------------
Until this is fixed in Bantam Tools, I've published the repair tool at:

    https://bantamfix.com

Users can upload their BRD files and download fixed versions. All processing
happens in the browser - no files are uploaded to any server.


IMPACT
------
This affects anyone using Fusion 360 to design PCBs. It's very easy to
accidentally use components from different library sources - Fusion's
interface doesn't make this obvious.

The silent failure is especially dangerous. Users might not notice missing
components until after they've milled their board.


NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review the test files to confirm the bug
2. Have engineering review the technical analysis and repair tool code
3. Implement the fix (estimated: straightforward, see implementation guide)
4. Consider adding a warning when duplicate library names are detected
