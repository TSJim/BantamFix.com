    <h1>Why BantamFix Exists</h1>

    <p>
        If you're here, you probably just spent way too long trying to figure out why
        some of your components aren't showing up in Bantam Tools. I've been there.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>
        When you design a PCB in <strong>Fusion 360</strong> and add components from different
        library sources (local libraries, Autodesk cloud libraries, team libraries), Fusion
        saves them as separate entries in the BRD file - even if they have the same library name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fusion uses a "URN" (Uniform Resource Name) to tell these libraries apart:
    </p>

    <pre>&lt;library name="pinhead-2"&gt;                    &lt;!-- local --&gt;
&lt;library name="pinhead-2" urn="urn:adsk..."&gt;  &lt;!-- cloud --&gt;</pre>

    <p>
        <strong>Bantam Tools ignores these URN identifiers.</strong> When it sees multiple libraries
        with the same name, it only keeps one of them. Components from the discarded libraries
        simply vanish - no error message, no warning.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It's Easy to Trigger</h2>

    <p>
        In Fusion 360's component browser, when you search for "pin header" or "1x04",
        you see results from all your library sources mixed together. They all show the
        same library name. It's very easy to grab components from different sources
        without realizing it.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
        <strong>The silent failure is the worst part.</strong> You design your board, export it,
        import it into Bantam, and some components just... aren't there. If you don't notice
        before milling, you've wasted time and material.
    </div>

    <h2>The Fix</h2>

    <p>
        This tool consolidates all libraries with the same name into a single library
        containing all the packages. Simple as that.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bantam Tools could (and should) do this automatically when loading a BRD file.
        Until they fix it, this tool does the job.
    </p>

    <h2>Is This Bantam's Fault?</h2>

    <p>
        Yes. The BRD file format explicitly supports multiple libraries with the same name,
        differentiated by URN. Fusion 360 exports valid files. Bantam's parser doesn't
        handle them correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've reported this bug to Bantam and provided them with:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Detailed technical analysis</li>
        <li>Test files that reproduce the issue</li>
        <li>This tool's source code as a reference implementation</li>
        <li>Pseudocode showing exactly how to fix their parser</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Hopefully they'll fix it soon and this site will become obsolete. Until then,
        <a href="index.html">the tool is here to help</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>

    <p>
        Your BRD files never leave your browser. All processing happens locally using
        JavaScript. I don't collect any data, have no analytics, and don't even have
        a server-side component. View the <a href="brd-fixer.js">source code</a> yourself.
